The `Functional MRI Laboratory <https://fmri.research.umich.edu/>`__ is an interdisciplinary unit organized under the University of Michigan Office of Research (UMOR). We are dedicated to supporting research on the structures and functions of the brain that underlie cognitive and affective processes, and research on functional MRI and associated research tools.

The Laboratoryâ€™s mission is to maintain an environment that will enhance the excellence of research using fMRI and associated technologies by providing a well-equipped physical facility and appropriate intellectual support services for investigators.

This ReadTheDocs page is an updated version of the lab's previous webpage, and we will be adding new sections to it over the coming months. Make sure to check back for more updates!
